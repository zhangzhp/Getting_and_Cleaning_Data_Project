Getting_and_Cleaning_Data_Project
=================================

This project takes a data set on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones and returns a tidy data set that shows the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The output data table is stored in the file tidy_data_set.txt.

In order to generate the tidy data set file one needs to run the R script run_analysis.R following the steps below:

1. Copy the input data folder, "UCI HAR Dataset", to the same directory as the R script. The input data is available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

2. Set R working directory to the same directory.

3. Run the R script.

The output tidy_data_set.txt will be created in the same directory.
